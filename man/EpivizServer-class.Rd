\title{Class providing WebSocket connection server}
\value{
RC object with methods for communication with epiviz JS app
}
\description{
Class providing WebSocket connection server
}
\details{
The most important aspect of the API of this server are methods \code{register_action} and \code{send_request}. These are
used to interact with the epiviz JS app through the provided websocket connection. \code{register_action(action, callback)} registers
a callback function to be executed upon request from the epiviz JS app. When the server receives a JSON message through the websocket, it
checks for an \code{action} field in the received request message, and then evaluates the expression \code{callback(message_data)} where \code{message_data}
is obtained from the \code{data} field in the received message. A response will be sent to the epiviz app with field \code{data} populated
with the result of the callback. If an error occurs during evaluation of the callback function, the response will be sent with field
\code{success} set to \code{false}.

To send requests to the JS app, method \code{send_request(request_data, callback)} should be used. This is sends a request to the JS app
with the \code{data} field populated with argument \code{request_data}. Once a response is received (with field \code{success} equal to \code{true})
the expression \code{callback(response_data)} is evaluated where \code{response_data} is obtained from the \code{data} field in the received
response message.
